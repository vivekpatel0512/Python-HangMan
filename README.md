# Python-HangMan
This is a simple HangMan game made in python which uses a while true loop with a for loop nested in it.  The secret word the player tries to guess is "Secret"  however if can be changed manually in the code to any word you like. 


What I learned / Skill uses
- Nested a For loop inside a While True loop
- If Else statments
- Time Module
